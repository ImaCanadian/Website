        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
            ImaCanadian. yeah, I'm the webmaster of this website.<br>
        </p>
        <h2>Nationalities</h2>
        <p>
            My alias is ImaCanadian and already you can most likely tell where im from. <br>
            along side me being Canadian <br> 
            im also Lebanese(from my mother) and native(from my father) <br>
            for which im native to a north dakota tribe, meaning i will 
            never go bold-also being american because of him. <br><br>
            Im a VERY gay men(Thank you Sebby)
            and pretty mush into anything gay i see online, all i gotta see is some thighs and you got me
            by the throat.
        </p>
        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>
            I have many interests. <br>
            like politics, love learning and looking into from time to time. <br><br>
            I LOVE art, 
            mostly the gay, cutesy kind. But i also like the normal kind too <br><br>
            I have a big fondness for anything coding, but I love games the most. <br><br>
            I like to make videos, I mostly like making
            review type videos about video games or the day to day scheme. <br>
            always been a fan of worldbuilding, whether its me doing it in my head or writing it out myself. 
            or when a game, show or any entertainment piece shows even a little of lore. <br>
            but the best worldbuilding for me is when ever its political, like when they
            show off a map or talk about countrys. <br>
            Alt-history is 
            my favorite interest out of all, there is just some much fun 
            in making up a scenario, adding worldbuilding, lots of politics and some
            art(to make it visual) and BAM, a whole new world(map) to explore! <br><br>
            many of my side interests are flags, maps, tech, plushies, vr and anything indie.
        </p>
        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
            My main hobbies are gaming, which most of the time im playing Hearts of iron 4. <br><br>
            Art, i got the hole sketchbook and everything. I will also start posting some actual
            stuff one day too somewhere. <br><br>
            Reading is a mostly new one for me as i never really enjoyed it before as I felt like I HAD to
            read and not just read to enjoy a story or to maybe learn something. I always felt I had to read
            anything given cause it was good for me but never fun, but now i can choose the books that I want 
            and it's really helped in me getting into it. Yes I feel very smart reading too. <br><br>
            I started journaling back in sept 2025 as a way to keep a record of everyday so that 
            i could realize that everyday was worth it. But I also started it as i felt like there was 
            something that I was missing and that others were doing but not me, which was journaling too me. <br><br>
            Last but not least, my side hobbies are cooking, working out and the hardest one drinking warm water.

            My Ideology is social democracy, as i believe that all governments are to work
            to make the lifes of there civilans the best that they can provide, while using
            the form of democracy to form society and use captialism to allow for public 
            and private to co-exist and work togather to make the best outta everything. 
            though I strongly believe that all essential things for living must be nationalized
            be the governemnt to keep them responsible to the people.
        </p> should i add this?-->
