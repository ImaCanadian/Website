                My first ever alias was created all the way back when me, my dad and brother needed to make a profile name's for me on the wii-u
                for which we (or my dad or me idk) created kreeperk256. <br><br>
                This was the same for my brother as well but he got the c version(creeper), 
                and as you can tell it was based off the creeper from Minecraft since we both loved the game so much. <br><br>
                The next part is with the k is... I really don't know, I like it though.
                Last and of course never least the numbers which were 256, why, I have no idea. <br><br>
                That was my main alias for a couple years and it's still here because of my roblox account, that account basically just being museum for my childhood. <br><br>
                I still use it though as I don't want to restart all my games or at least not yet.

        <div class="textline">
            <p>
                But soon as I got older, I really needed to start using a different name or at least thats what my dad wanted,
                because when I was going to play new world with him, he said that I shouldn't add numbers to my username. <br><br>
                Meaning I had to come up with a name quickly so that I could play with him, quickly I came up with ImanCanadian. 
                It sounds wrong,
                it's most likely wrong but i had to make it quickly so that I could play with him and he wouldn't get mad about my username. <br><br>
                Soon after making that alias,
                I started use it every else as since I was growing older I needed a better alias for me as kreeperk256 was a very childish alias and ImanCanadian was perfect. <br><br>
                I started to even make new accounts just to use the name, mostly because I thought everything was Reddit and that you couldn't 
                change your username's after some time.

    </div>

    <div class="ImaCanadian">
        <div class="textline">
            <p>
                After using that alias for years on and thinking that it would stay, I soon realized that... yeah it's not spelled correctly.
                That realization come after being made fun of about the name and asking around if it sounded good or not,
                did I change it to a better version of it as Im'A'Canadian. <br><br>
                The other reason that I keeped the name for so long was that, I did know about the name not sounding right,
                but I thought that If one day I would get popular it would start too sound better to people and like it,
                even though it's not spelled correctly.
