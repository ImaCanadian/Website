                    This is my first ever post for any type of blog, ever. <br>
                    Also this is basically for the 5.1 beta update as <br>
                    I've been wanting to add this since me finishing my <br>
                    About me page. <br><br>

                    I know I kinda suck at giving out news about me, really because I never really <br>
                    find the news worth the effort or need to show it, but if you want to see quicker <br>
                    news about me and this website development, <br>
                    go to my git hub I've started to use that place to store <br>
                    my code and also add stuff not already on my main website as I don't code on nekowebs
                    thing. Go take a look! <a href="https://github.com/ImaCanadian/Website" target="_blank">Updates.</a> <br><br>

                    God lots has been happening within my life, I been so over stressed that <br>
                    I had to take a break last weekend <br>
                    (still working mostly just had a little more time to relax[not think]). <br>
                    I mean there was a lot to go through, worrying about school, health and trying to <br>
                    "make due" with the time that was wasted doing nothing which has put a huge amount <br>
                    of pressure onto me which then lead to me being very overwhelmed by everything. <br>
                    I was though able to learn what was the whole time, that being the sence of no <br>
                    direction I was experiencing at that time. <br>
                    Now that I knew that I started to get myself back to developing my website which <br>
                    helped very much and brought me back to where I was at just two weeks ago. <br><br>

                    With all that I think I'm back to developing my website and for a good while now as <br>
                    I don't really have another project like this website where there are a lot of <br> 
                    things I can work on and learn about, also since this brings me a sence of <br>
                    achievement that I need. <br>
                    An additional thing is that I really need to accept that I need to have breaks, <br>
                    the expectations for me to do well in all these fields can get way to much as I <br>
                    have now learned from those last two weeks (9th-19th). <br><br>

                    Anyways as to note for you guys, most of this blog stuff and rss is still a <br>
                    work in progress as I'm still trying to get a design idea out and to maybe <br>
                    find other things to add to this, so most likly everything will change soon. <br><br>

                    if you want to send me any ideas or recommadations then you can send them to my <br>
                    <a href="https://imacanadian.atabook.org/" target="_blank">Guest Book</a> and say hi at the same time.
