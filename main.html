            <p>
                Finally setup the news page but with two sections, one being for news <br>
                about this website, or any news I want to give but on here instead <br> 
                and the second being for news coming from outside of this website weather it's about stuff out there <br>
                or just more news about here. Who knows. <br><br> 

                The hole framework is setup now so that I can finally store my news, soon I will design <br>
                this better, but I really just wanted a place to store my news quickly. <br><br>

                I finally made my first gif, which is being stored in my waving dude, go take a look.<br>

                I need to start using my fl studio more, I got the license right before the sale ended <br>
                (and I mean right before the end), but I have been trying to not force in to me but I <br>
                that now I have just been wasting it. The whole reason I started to get into music was because <br>
                of both getting back into Friday Night Funkin and watching this guy on youtube called mattp, <br>
                but since I've been more busy and don't have much time too play and mattp quit or a least <br>
                it seems like he did which means that I haven't been getting the inspo too make anything. <br>

                Started learning German, I have been thinking of adding <br>
                a way to change all the text to be translated into another <br>
                language though I was thinking of doing it with french but <br>
                I was not thinking of learning french as it didn't seem fun <br>
                (Thanks school). <br><br> 
                So I thought of learning German instead as <br>
                it seemed a lot more fun and I guess easier since were both <br>
                Germanic bothers and have some things in both languages would <br>
                be the same.
