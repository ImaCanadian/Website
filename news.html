                    Finally setup the news page, but with two sections, one being for news <br>
                    about this website or any news I want to give but do it on here and the second <br>
                    being for news coming from outside of this website weather it's about stuff out there <br>
                    or just more news about here. <br><br> 

                    The hole framework is setup now so that I can store my news easier, soon I will design <br>

                    I need to start using my fl studio more, I got the license right before the sale ended <br>
                    (and I mean right before the end), but I have been trying to not force in to me but I <br>
                    that now I have just been wasting it. The whole reason I started to get into music was because <br>
                    of both getting back into Friday Night Funkin and watching this guy on youtube called mattp, <br>
                    but since I've been more busy and don't have much time too play and mattp quit or a least <br>
                    it seems like he did which means that I haven't been getting the inspo too make anything. <br>

                        Started learning German, I have been thinking of adding <br>
                        a way to change all the text to be translated into another <br>
                        language though I was thinking of doing it with french but <br>
                        I was not thinking of learning french as it didn't seem fun <br>
                        (Thanks school). <br><br> 
                        So I thought of learning German instead as <br>
                        it seemed a lot more fun and I guess easier since were both <br>
                        Germanic bothers and have some things in both languages would <br>
                        be the same.

        <h1>First message</h1>
        <p>
            After 3 mouths of getting the idea to make this and stopping a mouth in-do too wanting to work on other things and ideas. 
            I finally restarted the whole thing and now got the main page down, not finished of course. But a very good start.

            Got some images running, cool font, two sections finished and the coolest part of this update is that. 
            I change the mouse design and got rid of the scrollbars!

            I do have to get the links working, come up with more ideas to put here, add a good background, 
            add some functionalty to the map and anything and everything else.

            hope you enjoy whats here though! (oﾟvﾟ)ノ</p>

        <h1>About me update message</h1>
        <p>
            Back at again with a new update. <br>
            Made the main page that I imagine most people want to see which was the about me page(Which is actual called about that canadian page)
            I also added the literal about me page. <br>
            Inside that page there is also
            my main info, <br>
            sections of me to add to, my likes and dislikes,
            and a bunch of other weird stuff.

            I also added a cool ass dropdown menu so that I can store all the updates for
            later looking for people wanting to know.
            Also updated the map.....have fun.</p>

        <h1>"Small" Changes message</h1>
        <p>
            Well...as you can see it's a lot less Canadian.
            Thats for a reason. After thinking about it, I think its better this way as I felt it would just ward off people as many would just see this as
            dick riding of Canada,
            and that it could make me egotistical about my country.
            But I also got rid of it as I tryed and failed to get a sort of website lore/world to work out.

            In other news I added a warning page, mostly cause I imagine that most don't like politics or even political jokes
            (which most of the site is going to be but still).
            I also added a intro because I didn't want to have the warning and
            welcome message be together.

            The main page also got a design overhaul, and... just look at the code.</p>

        <h1>Optimize update message</h1>
        <p>
            Lots of stuff added in this update.
            I, as a very big fan of optimizing, have been able to optimize alot,
            mostly with in the style.css file but still good all-round.

            I added the Oscar thing down there, that's going to be the place where I
            Put my shrines as a listing page, still not ready but it is a big look into the future of the website.

            Added the "About my PFP's page" and "About my Alias[es]" into this update,
            both are pretty unfinished. But my goal for right now is not to get the design down, just the framework.
            Help's take workload off me and more info for you.

            Changed and added some other stuff like backgrounds and where links take you.

            But other wise I hope you find it fun to read! (^///^)

            Also the hole like background being a sky was too show how my website is coming back to earth and being alittle bit more normal.
            I think I'm going to change it but I don't know.</p>

        <h1>Link update message</h1>
        <p>
            Toke a little break so that I could work on doing game dev
            and too to work on school before my semester ends.

            I was having alot of trouble during the devlopment of this update as
            I was really worried about how my website-as I was started too use a lot more
            javascript-was going to get really inefficient.

            But I just realized that "I'm new and don't know better" so I just went with it.
            I was able to figure out some better code for that other Thing I was worried about but
            I still learned alot from that whole ordeal.

            But yeah, added the link pages and a few secret pages.
            Next update is going to be the news page and what ever else I make.
            that's it, see ya.
