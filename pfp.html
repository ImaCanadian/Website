                    It was almost 10am in the morning of May 11th, I was <br>
                    playing Bee Swarm Simulator™ when all of the sudden... <br>

                    When I saw what your seeing right now, I had the most <br><br><br>

                    childish reation to what I thought of was <br>
                    devil tits. <br><br>
                    But....How did this happen? And with what? Well it started with these two items.

                <p>
                    which with enough luck(I guess) and it being the beginning, <br>
                    making it easier to get the exact number, I got it. <br>
                    And yes its a VERY reddit style number. <br><br>

                    here's the exact location of the image.<br>

                <p>
                    This image from then on become my main pfp for years, <br>
                    Being used on Youtube, Twitter, Instagram, my first Reddit account, twitch with nothing else <br>
                    being able top the legend that was this image. <br>
                    making it much more personal to me then just making a pfp <br>
                    from scratch. Also because I had nothing else too use.

        <h2>This pfp was the first one I ever made.</h2>
            <p>
                This was made for Reddit for some reason, <br>
                I really don't know why I made this, I don't know what made me think that <br>
                Reddit was more important than something like Youtube or Twitter. <br>
                I guess too me at the time when I made that for my Second Reddit account, <br> I still felt that 
                Reddit was the most important in it being the most personal display of me. <br>
                So to me it needed a better, more suitable pfp. <br><br>

                I also think that it was supposed to be a new and "better" pfp <br>
                then the main one I was using for years. So I thought that it needed <br>
                a redo and something to freshin things up, but it never clicked.

                <p>
                    I found this on Amazon  one day and due to how shity The image crop was on the page, <br> 
                    I thought that it would be funny to save it for later. <br>
                    A little bit afterwords I was starting to get into chess and I needed a pfp for the <br>
                    account and since this was the most recent picture (or atleast I think it was the most recent) <br>
                    I used it for chess.

                <h2>Story</h2>
                <p>
                    First of all, I'm not that I swear. <br><br>
                    I was Starting to get into all the history stuff and soon, the alt-history stuff, so much that <br>
                    I wanted to have wallpapers for my phone and pc that were alt-hist stuff about Canada. <br>
                    But then I realized that I needed to change my pfp for my discord, <br>
                    I dont know if I had one before but, the point still stands. <br>
                    So I used this, it worked out fine and I also liked how it was perfectly cropped for the image size. <br>
                    But soon, and when I mean soon I mean like a year or years later,<br> I saw that when <br>
                    your in a call and you full screen the call it looks like the hole flag is there, <br>
                    since that discord takes the outside colours and spreads them out like a rectangle. <br><br>

                    So, I've never changed it as it's pretty funny too me.
